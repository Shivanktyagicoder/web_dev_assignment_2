            <h1>Henry Ford</h1><hr>
            <p>Henry Ford (July 30, 1863 – April 7, 1947) was an American industrialist and business magnate. As the founder of the Ford Motor Company, he is credited as a pioneer in making automobiles affordable for middle-class Americans through the system that came to be known as Fordism.[1][2] In 1911, he was awarded a patent for the transmission mechanism that would be used in the Ford Model T and other automobiles.</p><br>
            <p>Ford was born in a farmhouse in Springwells Township, Michigan, and left home at the age of 16 to find work in Detroit.[3] It was a few years before this time that Ford first experienced automobiles, and throughout the later half of the 1880s, he began repairing and later constructing engines, and through the 1890s worked with a division of Edison Electric. He founded the Ford Motor Company in 1903 after prior failures in business, but success in constructing automobiles.</p>

           <h2>Early Life</h2><hr>
           <p>Henry Ford was born July 30, 1863, on a farm in Springwells Township, Michigan.[5] His father, William Ford (1826–1905), was born in County Cork, Ireland, to a family that had emigrated from Somerset, England in the 16th century.[6] His mother, Mary Ford (née Litogot; 1839–1876), was born in Michigan as the youngest child of Belgian immigrants; her parents died when she was a child and she was adopted by neighbors, the O'Herns. Henry Ford's siblings were John Ford (1865–1927); Margaret Ford (1867–1938); Jane Ford (c. 1868–1945); William Ford (1871–1917) and Robert Ford (1873–1877). Ford finished eighth grade at a one-room school,[7] Springwells Middle School. He never attended high school; he later took a bookkeeping course at a commercial school.<br>

           His father gave him a pocket watch when he was 12. At 15, Ford dismantled and reassembled the timepieces of friends and neighbors   dozens of times, gaining the reputation of a watch repairman.[9] At twenty, Ford walked four miles to their Episcopal church every   Sunday.[10]</p>

            <h2>Career</h2><hr>
            <p>In 1891, Ford became an engineer with the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit. After his promotion to Chief Engineer in 1893, he had enough time and money to devote attention to his experiments on gasoline engines. These experiments culminated in 1896 with the completion of a self-propelled vehicle, which he named the Ford Quadricycle. He test-drove it on June 4. After various test drives, Ford brainstormed ways to improve the Quadricycle.<br>

            Also in 1896, Ford attended a meeting of Edison executives, where he was introduced to Thomas Edison. Edison approved of Ford'sautomobile experimentation. Encouraged by Edison, Ford designed and built a second vehicle, completing it in 1898.[17] Backed bythe capital of Detroit lumber baron William H. Murphy, Ford resigned from the Edison Company and founded the Detroit AutomobileCompany on August 5, 1899.[17] However, the automobiles produced were of a lower quality and higher price than Ford wanted.Ultimately, the company was not successful and was dissolved in January 1901.[17]</p>

           <h4>Ford Motor Company</h4>
            <p>In response, Malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the Dodge brothers to accept a portion of the new company.[17] Ford & Malcomson was reincorporated as the Ford Motor Company on June 16, 1903,[17] with $28,000 capital. The original investors included Ford and Malcomson, the Dodge brothers, Malcomson's uncle John S. Gray, Malcolmson's secretary James Couzens, and two of Malcomson's lawyers, John W. Anderson and Horace Rackham. Because of Ford's volatility, Gray was elected president of the company. Ford then demonstrated a newly designed car on the ice of Lake St. Clair, driving 1 mile (1.6 km) in 39.4 seconds and setting a new land speed record at 91.3 miles per hour (146.9 kilometres per hour). Convinced by this success, race driver Barney Oldfield, who named this new Ford model "999" in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day, took the car around the country, making the Ford brand known throughout the United States. Ford also was one of the early backers of the Indianapolis 500.[18]</p>
            <h4>Model T</h4>
            <p>The Model T debuted on October 1, 1908. It had the steering wheel on the left, which every other company soon copied. The entire engine and transmission were enclosed; the four cylinders were cast in a solid block; the suspension used two semi-elliptic springs. The car was simple to drive, and easy and inexpensive to repair. It was so inexpensive at $825 in 1908 ($27,980 today), with the price falling every year, that by the 1920s, a majority of American drivers had learned to drive on the Model T.[20][21]</p>

            <h2>Personal interests</h2><hr>
            <p>A compendium of short biographies of famous Freemasons, published by a Freemason lodge, lists Ford as a member.[127] The Grand Lodge of New York confirms that Ford was a Freemason, and was raised in Palestine Lodge No. 357, Detroit, in 1894. When he received the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite in 1940, he said, "Masonry is the best balance wheel the United States has."[128]

            In 1923, Ford's pastor, and head of his sociology department, Episcopal minister Samuel S. Marquis, claimed that Ford believed, or"once believed," in reincarnation.[129]
                
            Ford published an anti-smoking book, circulated to youth in 1914, called The Case Against the Little White Slaver, whichdocumented many dangers of cigarette smoking attested to by many researchers and luminaries.[130] At the time, smoking wasubiquitous and not yet widely associated with health problems, making Ford's opposition to cigarettes unusual.</p>
